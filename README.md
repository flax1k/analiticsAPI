Analytics API: Python quickstart for service accounts

This tutorial walks through the steps required to access a Google Analytics account, query the Analytics APIs, handle the API responses, and output the results. The Core Reporting API v3.0, Management API v3.0, and OAuth2.0 are used in this tutorial. 

The purpose of this quickstart guide is to help you get through the initial hurdles of API authorization with the Google API Client Libraries. As these libraries are under active development, this guide may occasionally fall out of sync with the latest client libraries.
